      <h2>What is Responsible Gaming?</h2>
      <p>
        Responsible gaming refers to a set of social responsibility initiatives adopted by the gaming industry,
        including video game companies and tournament organizers. It promotes a safe and fair gaming environment
        where players can enjoy their hobby without negative impacts on their personal, professional, or financial lives.
      </p>
      <p>Responsible gaming practices include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting time and money limits for gaming activities</li>
        <li>Maintaining a balance between gaming and other life activities</li>
        <li>Recognizing signs of problematic gaming behavior</li>
        <li>Providing resources for those who may need help</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At NoctaZone, we are committed to fostering a responsible gaming environment for all our participants.</p>

      <h2>What is a Gaming Disorder?</h2>
      <p>
        Gaming disorder is a condition recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pattern of persistent or
        recurrent gaming behavior that takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities.
      </p>
      <p>Key characteristics include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Impaired control over gaming (frequency, intensity, duration)</li>
        <li>Increasing priority given to gaming over other activities</li>
        <li>Continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's important to note that enjoying video games as a hobby doesn't necessarily indicate a disorder. A gaming
        disorder is diagnosed when gaming behavior significantly impairs personal, family, social, educational, or
        occupational functioning for at least 12 months.
      </p>

      <h2>What if I'm Concerned About a Family Member?</h2>
      <p>If you're worried about a family member's gaming habits, here are some steps you can take:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open a dialogue:</strong> Approach the subject with empathy and without judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe behavior:</strong> Look for signs of neglecting other activities, withdrawal from social interactions, or declining performance at work or school.</li>
        <li><strong>Encourage balance:</strong> Help them set realistic time limits for gaming and engage in other activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek professional help:</strong> If the problem persists, consult a mental health professional specializing in behavioral addictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Be supportive:</strong> Offer emotional support and help them find alternative activities they enjoy.</li>
      </ul>
